				<p><a href="http://localhost:4000/about/TSullivanResume.pdf">Resume here</a> (last updated September 2016)</p>

<p>I am a computational linguist, presently studying at the University of Arizona in the Human Language Technology program.</p>

<p>As for the contents of this website, this is a place for me to post my thoughts, written work, and development logs. I post here on a roughly monthly basis.</p>

<p>Academically, I specialize in computational syntax, practical implementations of syntactic theories.</p>

<p>Professionally, I work on state-of-the-art search technologies, to improve the run performance and user experience of database or web searching. I also have expertise in other areas of natural language processing, including statistical and rule-based (automaton) methods of parsing, sentiment analysis, translation, synthesis, and recognition, to varying degrees.</p>

<p>I’m well versed in Object Oriented Programming, and test-driven development, as many Computer Science graduates are, but I am at the same time aware that it is not often practical for industry applications, and I am more than willing to adapt.</p>

<p>I am comfortable working in Java and Python, these are my go-to languages, but I also have a various degrees of experience in each of: Perl, Prolog, Matlab, C#, C, and MIPS assembly, in roughly decreasing order of comfort.  I’m also proficient in client-side web technologies (HTML/CSS/Javascript) and the Django web backend, based on Python.</p>

<p>As a hobby, I am a cryptography enthusiast, a pc gamer, and an amateur historian. I host and produce the semiweekly <strong>Great Persons</strong> podcast with my cohost Jared Feindt. (launch in August 2016, working title)</p>

<h1 id="biography">Biography</h1>

<p>I grew up in South Jersey, in the greater Philadelphia, and there are some vestigiges of that upbringing in my accent, particularly back vowels and the odd pronunciation of particular lexemes, like “water”.</p>

<p>My father is a network engineer, and his employers got tired of flying him across the country to work on their machines, so they moved us to Arizona, where there is no rain, no humidity, and no natural disasters: the ideal location for server farms and tech offices.</p>

<p>Upon arrival in Arizona I found the quality of public education in the state which spends the least money per capita on education… underwhelming, so I was soon enrolled in a private school that was marginally better.</p>

<p>I was invited to attend a brand new High School in Glendale, AZ, the Glendale Preparatory Academy, a rigorous liberal-arts education that was far above the standards of surrounding area education, so I jumped at the chance to join. It was there that I discovered my love for language, history, and the classics. I was a high-ranking member of the first graduating class, 23 students in total, and I moved to Tucson to attend the University of Arizona. There were some business shakeups that resulted in my family running off to Maryland the very same week. Literally, my dad dropped me off at the dorm, and then just kept going on the I-10 all the way to Savannah, then to Annapolis.</p>

<p>At the time I fancied myself a musician, and I was in the College of Music as a vocal student. However, towards the end of my first year, I found that I enjoyed my linguistics classes much more than the music ones. That discovery, combined with a bout of laryngitis on finals week and an excellent summer course in Linux system administration, led me to change focus towards Computer Science and Linguistics.</p>

<p>I was an outdoorsman, spending on average one weekend a month on some major outdoor activity, and I served two summers as an instructor for several nature-related merit badges at Camp Roosevelt in New Jersey. However, once I made Eagle and left the Boy Scouts and Venture Scouts, my feelings of adventure were subsumed into academic pursuits.</p>

<p>I am an avid fan of JRR Tolkien’s work. I generally read Lord of the Rings at least once a year, and I recently acquired the first five books of the Histories of Middle Earth, and I am slowly working through them. In High School I learned to read and write, and to some very minor degree speak, Sindarin, and I often take notes or write secret messages in Tengwar.</p>
