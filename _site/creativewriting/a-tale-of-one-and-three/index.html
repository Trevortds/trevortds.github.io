				<p>Boy was I obsessed with classics when I wrote this so long ago. My teacher told me to get it published, but I didn’t feel like it was good. Well guess what! Now it is published! On a blog that nobody reads!</p>

<hr />

<p>“You simply don’t have the evidence”</p>

<p>“I saw the woman, I’m telling you she ran when she saw him.”</p>

<p>The accused sat ‘cuffed to a bench on the opposite end of the
room. He wore clothes typical of his kind, a long, black and
tattered coat, boots that were without a doubt the wrong side
for him, and a poor looking lopsided hat with a large hole in
the left side.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I can’t tell the judge that I heard from
someone who heard from someone else that this man is dangerous.
You realize that he will order the man released immediately.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I saw the look on her face, she witnessed a murder.”</p>

<p>“And you did not, that’s my problem. If there was a murder,
where is the body?”</p>

<p>“I told you, I didn’t have time. If you would just send out a
scouting team-”</p>

<p>“I don’t have the resources! You know how stretched our
department is!”</p>

<p>Daniel stopped to think for a moment. He was an officer of the
downtown district of New Tyre, A&amp;E division. He was a rather
short man, and was not as strong as most other officers, but
knew more about anatomy and weapons use than any of them. He
had short dark hair, and was rarely seen out of his well-used
black uniform. Daniel loves helping people, and will gladly
work day and night to benefit society. Today, however, the
Chief is in his way.</p>

<p>“What if we charge him for something else?” he said, “Just to
keep him here long enough for me to inspect the scene.”</p>

<p>The Chief thought a minute and replied, “The best I can do is
charge him with a breach of the peace for the commotion in the
street he caused. However, you certainly don’t have evidence
enough to post bail over fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>The man furrowed his brow.</p>

<p>“You can’t go any higher?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p>This was beginning to irritate Daniel. “That man is a threat to
the life of our citizens!”</p>

<p>“You haven’t shown me that.”</p>

<p>“You won’t let me!” he shouted. “That man killed someone
today, and you’re going to let him go!”</p>

<p>“Because you only have secondhand evidence”</p>

<p>“It’s still evidence!”</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” the Chief said gruffly. He was in his
forties, sitting behind his desk in a crisp, perfectly tailored
blue uniform. His hair was neatly combed and his hands were
folded neatly in his lap, he looked at Daniel like a nurse
looks down on a misbehaving child. Their eyes remained locked
for a moment, then the Chief turned to the man on the bench.
“What is your name, sir?”</p>

<p>The man looked up darkly. “Daifotismenos.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I could’ve guessed.”</p>

<p>So this man was one of The Enlightened. Daniel clenched a fist.
These people are low lifes. The leeches of society. They reject
technology and the development of society. They only live in the
city because there are more people to steal from. When Daniel is
on the street he would catch or kill them on recognition. They
are all criminals. Surely the Chief won’t let him go now.</p>

<p>The chief continued,“Do you have money enough to pay the bail?”</p>

<p>“Yes”, the man replied fearfully.</p>

<p>He was doing this to spite Daniel. It’s against the law to
release an Enlightened from police custody. The Chief must be
testing Daniel.</p>

<p>To Daniel’s surprise he stood up (a very rare occurrence) walked
around the desk and over to the seated man. He stood in front of
him a moment, and then extended his hand. The Enlightened man
slowly, carefully reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a
bundle of bills. Daniel couldn’t watch anymore.</p>

<p>“He stole that money!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Did someone on the street tell you that as well?” the Chief
retorted.</p>

<p>Embarrassed and enraged, Daniel remained silent. The Chief took
the money from the man with a quick movement, then reached into
his pocket for a key. He moved to free the man. The cuff came
free, and the man immediately leapt up and ran to the door. He
went out onto the street without another word.</p>

<p>Daniel was enraged. “You can’t just let him go!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“You had no proof against him, I can’t keep him” the old man
replied, with a smirk.</p>

<p>“He gave you proof. Every day for the last three years I’ve
been on the street hunting men like him. They’re theives,
murderers, they hold no respect for human life, and who knows
what unholy rituals they perform nightly in their dens. You let
him go!”</p>

<p>The man closed his eyes for a short moment. “They’re not all
bad,” he replied.</p>

<p>Daniel resisted the urge to reach for my gun. “What makes you
think that?” he asked.</p>

<p>The smirk was still on the Chief’s face. “Only sixty per cent of
those executed are brought in for murder.”</p>

<p>Daniel was tired of this man. He always seems to be trying to
prevent him from doing what he needs to do, simply to irritate
him. The Chief is as devoted to their duty as Daniel is, but he
never lets him do it. Daniel set my shoulders back, and slowly
replied, “I swore to defend the law, and you are in my way.”</p>

<p>The Chief suddenly grinned. He’d gotten what he wanted from
Daniel apparently. “I’m not keeping you from going after him.”</p>

<p>So that was it. He was trying to make the officer look cruel to
this man. He wanted Daniel to be scorned, to be feared.</p>

<p>Daniel set his jaw, turned, and walked out the glass door onto a
busy street. People were walking in both directions in great
quantities, the road was full of cars. Behind him was a
concrete staircase the leads up to the A&amp;E division
headquarters, a tower fifty stories tall. The exterior is
composed completely of concrete and steel, one foot thick with
no windows. The City Government spares no expense on outfitting
its police force. For miles in each direction are nothing but
tall buildings, most of them significantly larger than the
concrete fortress. The street was a hallway of steel and glass.
This was his domain.</p>

<p>The city is arranged in square blocks, some one hundred meters
long. There are no alleyways, only building faces on all sides
of each block. Daniel’s opponent would most likely run north,
into the heart of the city, where his people lurk.</p>

<p>The crowd contained a multitude of people, some businessmen in
suits headed to corporate meetings, low class labourers in
thick, dirty clothes, and plenty of civilians on the street
visiting shops and sightseeing. The faces of towers were on
Daniel’s left, the street packed with taxis, busses, and
privately owned vehicles on his right. He had no trouble moving
through the thick crowd, they all moved out of his way.</p>

<p>That was the worst part of Daniel’s job. Everyone seemed to be
afraid of him, many even hated him. They all quickly moved to
avoid him. The men in suits nodded his way and moved aside. The
workers in dirty, worn clothes bowed their heads and sidestepped
around him, as if they were used to that sort of thing. The
normal people just forced smiles and jumped towards the
storefronts. Not a one looked in his eye, in fear of some
unjust retribution.</p>

<p>Daniel always wondered why they always fear him as he increases
his pace on the sidewalk. He only wants to protect them.
Everyone who knew Daniel, really knew him, loved his
personality, his lightheartedness, and his devotion to the good
of everyone else. People on the street don’t want to know
anyone, they just go their way, only wanting to help
themselves. What is it about being in public that makes
everyone else so cold?</p>

<p>Daniel turned his attention back to his target. When he left the
office he saw the man run north and turn the first corner.
Daniel had turned that corner as well, and the man he sought
was two hundred feet ahead of him, shoving startled passerbys
out of his way. He shouted at the man, and ran towards him.</p>

<p>The criminal looked over his shoulder. He appeared horrified.
The look he gave Daniel was exactly what Daniel feared the
most. He viewed Daniel as a torturer, an evil hunter in the
night. Most other officers somehow take satisfaction from that
terror, but Daniel abhors it. Then
Daniel remembered the crimes that the low-life had committed,
that this man fears him for the same reason that the wolf fears
the hunter’s bow, and Daniel put on a burst of speed. The man
redoubled his efforts to shoulder his way through the throng of
people.</p>

<p>The outlaw had made it through the group that was waiting for
the crosswalk to clear, and he ran into the street. Moments
later, Daniel made it to the same place.</p>

<p>He could still see him, the murderer made an aisle of shocked
men in women as he ran (if one could call pushing body after
body aside “running”) down the sidewalk on the other side of
the street. Unfortunately, the amount of traffic on the road
seemed to have increased since the fugitive crossed. There was
a clear line between Daniel and his quarry, but he dared not
use his firearm in fear that some foolish man, distracted by
his own thoughts, would come between them. The man turned a
corner and was lost to Daniel’s sight</p>

<p>It felt like an eternity before the signal to walk lit up.
Daniel dashed across the street, sprinted as quickly to the
other end of the block, rounded the corner, and looked around
for his prey.</p>

<p>He was nowhere in sight. The people did not look startled, or
even distracted. They just kept walking their own way,
distracted, looking out only for themselves. The businessmen on
phones, workers in dirty overalls, and tourists in overly casual
clothing walked widely around him in irrational fear. Brick,
concrete, and steel on his left, the deceptively docile road on
his right, Daniel stood rigid in his place, looking in vain for
the object of his detest.</p>

<p>He ran to the end of the street, shouldering his way through the
crowds, and then ran back, but the Diafotismenos was nowhere to
be found. Susipicious once again, Daniel left the scene,
promising himself to come back later.</p>

<hr />

<p>Daniel peered through the window. He saw a well lit room inside,
with a low, artfully crafted table in the center, and two
rich-looking chairs at either end. The table had a bouquet in
the center, but was otherwise empty. These sat on top of a
thick, round rug that made the room look very small. Seeing
noone inside, Daniel moved around the corner towards the door.</p>

<p>The door was made of wood, very uncommon even among buildings of
this age, painted a dark green. It had an old fashioned round
knob, plated with gold. Daniel carefully examined the
doorframe, for he knew to be very careful around the
Diafotismenos lairs. The frame was also wooden, with a classic
trim pattern. Seeing no dangers or traps, he reached out and
slowly turned the knob.</p>

<p>Daniel stepped into the room and was shocked by the warmth
inside. He was tempted to take off his long trench coat that
served as a disguise. There was a wood-burning stove in the
corner opposite Daniel on the right, with a black pipe
stretching into the ceiling and beyond. The scent of the
burning wood was a welcome respite from the normal fumes of
fuel and smoke in the streets. The wall on the left contained
an additional fireplace, with a very old-looking brick mantle.
Some artfully wrought iron fire-tending tools hung from a rack
on the left of the fireplace.</p>

<p>Opposite the fireplace was the window Daniel got his first
glimpse of the room through. Right under the window was a altar
of sorts, with two tall candles and a gold filigree centerpiece.
The design was very abstract, Daniel did not recognize it. On
the face of the altar was some inscription in a Cyrillic
script, there was no time to translate it.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until now that Daniel realized that this room only had
one exit. The wall opposite the door was void of any decoration
or furniture, and the space on the other four walls were taken
up by the altar, the fireplace, and the door that Daniel came
through. He reached across his body and slipped his gun from
its holster, then quickly turned and opened the door, sensing
some trickery on the part of his foes.</p>

<p>Daniel turned back into the building and began to search. He
briskly walked into the back right corner, and knelt on the
floor beside the iron stove. Seeing nothing under it, he darted
across the room to the fireplace, examining the mantle and
fireplace itself for some sort of trigger. It would be just
like these crazy people to hide a passageway in a fireplace.
Daniel ran his hand all the way around the edge of the stone
structure, but found nothing. He went back to the center of the
small room, and with some difficulty moved the chairs to examine
the floor for some sort of trapdoor. He looked at the contents
of the table, just a simple china setting with silver utensils.
In the center of the table was a cup containing fifteen or so
small stones.</p>

<p>Daniel looked up at the altar again. It was plated with silver,
probably wood beneath. Sitting atop it was a thick piece of
gold, or something plated with gold. It was carved with some
random, abstract design. Daniel walked around the table to the
altar and looked closely at the object sitting on top of it. It
rose up from its base in curved lines that twisted around each
other, making what seemed to be a solid object, but for a few
small, irregularly spaced, yet identical gaps through which
Daniel could see the plain white wall. On the rim of the altar
was an inscription:</p>

<p>Αστρονομυ cομπελσ τηε σοτηλ το λοοκ τηπωαρδσ ανδ λεαδσ τησ φρομ
τηισ ωορλδ το ανοτηερ</p>

<p>~Πλατώ</p>

<p>Daniel reached into his breast pocket and pulled out his pad,
and began transliterating the text, letter by letter. The
common people can’t read writing like this, so the
Diafotismenoi use it as a code. They were never clever enough
to change it after thousands of years of continuous use, so it
was usually a quick decypher:</p>

<p>Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from
this world to another.</p>

<p>~Plato</p>

<p>Daniel thought for a moment, then looked yet again at the figure
atop the altar. He noticed that three of the holes in the ornate
structure were very near each other in the center, immediately
he recognized the solution. He spun around and grabbed the
small bowl off of the table, and one by one filled each of the
holes on the gold object with a pebble from the cup. When the
last pebble went in, he was looking at an image of the
constellation Orion. He heard several simultaneous clicks
within the altar, and pushed it to his left, revealing a
staircase descending into the floor. Daniel checked that his
radio was off, and his weapon safely holstered, and he began
his descent.</p>

<p>The altar slid to the left, revealing a staircase that descended
along the wall. Daniel looked around the room one last time,
then checked over his disguise before taking the first step
down.</p>

<p>The stairway led down only a man’s height, Daniel had to duck a
bit not to hit his head on the floor of the upper room on the
way down. There was another Greek note written on the wall, but
Daniel didn’t bother to transliterate it. It looked somewhat
haphazard, and added after the building was constructed. Daniel
guessed that it was a reminder to close the passageway, so he
reached up and pushed the altar back into its original
position.</p>

<p>He walked into the tunnel that was only just tall enough for him
to stand in. After a short distance it made a left turn, and
Daniel followed the turn. A much longer descending staircase
awaited him, and he followed it.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the tunnel was an open doorway. Daniel stepped
through the doorway and was amazed at what faced him.</p>

<p>A golden doorway at least twenty feet high was across a wide
chamber. A huge circular ageis was worked into the center, with
an arc of philosophical text stretching across the top edge.
There were no handles on the door; it seemingly could only be
opened from the inside. A pair of men stood on either side of
the door. They wore trenchcoats over ceremonial breastplates,
crested helms, and they both carried spears. They certainly
won’t be helping me get in.</p>

<p>Daniel looked around the wide space. The walls were made of
stone blocks with no decoration. In the two corners opposite
the gateway were a pair of medium sized round tables with a few
Diafotismenoi sitting around them. Daniel walked over to the
table on his right. Two men in expectable garb sat opposite one
another, drinking some strange beverage Daniel would rather not
touch. They were discussing some matter of importance to
themselves. Daniel inturrupted them with a greeting.</p>

<p>“Mae govannen, melyn. Iran dolthad cham”</p>

<p>“Le suilon. Licet.” one of them replied. He was thin, with
oily black hair. Daniel percieved no suspicious looks, so he
began to talk.</p>

<p>“Do you spend most of your time here?” Daniel asked.</p>

<p>“I do. I have lived most of my life in this place.” he said,
looking around.</p>

<p>This would be the hard part. To make it convincing, Daniel would
have to use all of his expertise and training to speak in a
fashion these men would recognize.</p>

<p>“I am visiting from a sanctuary in the eastern suburbs.” he
said, hoping for a favorable response.</p>

<p>“Ah. I have been there.” he said, with one corner of his mouth
turned up.</p>

<p>Oh no. Here I have to be very careful. “How often?” Daniel
asked.</p>

<p>The man looked up. “Only once, but it was a pleasant
experience.”</p>

<p>Daniel came close to sighing relief. His original plan was to
manuever this one into revealing the means for entering the
inner sanctuaries, but Daniel knew little to nothing about any
of the other lairs, and now he can’t use unfamiliarity as an
excuse, since he did not know how his claimed origin works.</p>

<p>Daniel talked to them for some time afterwards on the natures of
language, music, and drink before he thanked the gruff man and
excused himself. He would have to work hard to maintain his
disguise. He approached the large door, and stopped in front of
it to examine its marvelously intricate carvings are reliefs. He
walked to the left side of the door and came to the guard , and
said with a generic accent, “I am visiting from elsewhere. How
may I pass through this door?”</p>

<p>The guard didn’t turn his head. “Ú-vinnal.” You don’t.</p>

<p>Daniel looked left and right, but there were no signs of attack
or ambush. He kept his cool, and asked again, “Please sir, I
need to get inside.”</p>

<p>This time the guard made no response at all.</p>

<p>Giving up, Daniel walked across the room towards the guard on
the other side. He again addressed the man in armor, “Mae
govannen, melyn.”</p>

<p>He responded in kind.</p>

<p>Daniel continued, ”Forgive me, I am visiting from elsewhere, how
do I get through the gate?”</p>

<p>“You can’t get through the gate.” he said with a tiny vestige
of a smile.</p>

<p>“There must be a way through.”</p>

<p>“Follow me.“ He led Daniel to the right corner of the large
chamber and he pressed on one of the huge blocks that formed
the wall. To Daniel’s surprise, the stone slid inwards, that a
large section of the wall was a hollow passageway. It extended
back towards the gate inside the wall of the room. Daniel
thanked the guard and entered the passageway, sliding the block
into place behind him.</p>

<p>Daniel emerged from the passage running through the wall into
another large room, perhaps three quarters the size of the last
one. As he entered the room, he noticed the wall to his left was
very close to the passageway entrance. That huge door must open
into solid rock, or not open at all. Daniel pondered this as he
looked around the room.</p>

<p>This chamber appeared to be some sort of common area. There was
only one other door, it was on the opposite wall in the center,
similar designs as the great majestic gate, but much smaller.
The room was filled with Diafotismenoi, making idle
conversation. Old fashioned, incandescent bulbs on the ceiling
lighted the long tables that ran along the length of the hall,
and one wall was lined with what seemed to be a buffet table.
Daniel walked around the edge of the room, and found that it
was a buffet table, and was just now beginning to serve the
chattering throng.</p>

<p>Rather than awkwardly asking around, Daniel decided to wait
until someone else moved through the far door before he
attempted it. Suddenly feeling hungry, Daniel checked his
outfit compared to everyone else’s one more time, just to make
sure he wouldn’t stand out, and he got in line for food.</p>

<p>He sat across from a pair of Diafotismenoi, a male and a female,
who appeared to be a couple. They were constantly smiling at
each other, and each seemed perfectly content with the other.
They laughed and joked and carried on like a normal family. No,
like a perfect one.</p>

<p>On Daniel’s right was a small mean with secondhand, damaged
glasses, who laid a book on the table when he sat down, and
immediately began reading it after he was finished reading. He
had hair down to his shoulders, longer than most me, (a common
trait among the Diafotismenos apparently), It was dark and
seemed to flare out at the ends. Daniel saw that his book was
titled “Magnanimity: pride vs prudence”, and he flipped through
it much faster than Daniel could with most of his books.</p>

<p>On Daniel’s left was a tall, fair-skinned woman with long,
beautiful read hair, and bright green eyes. She seemed to have
a say in everything, she ate little and did most of the talking
for Daniel’s part of the table.</p>

<p>The man across the table was completely engrossed in his lover,
and never spoke unless she herself entered the conversation
without him. He was an experienced man for his age, and had
many stories that Daniel intently listened to. He talked about
his education, the places he’s visited, things he’s learned,
and the scores of people he’s met. The redhead always wanted to
interrupt his stories by recalling anecdote f her own, and the
conversation usually moved along without her. Whenever they
touched on a scientific, or philosophical note, the glasses man
looked up and gave his brief opinion, which itself drew some
discussion from the rest, while he went back into his
philosophical text.</p>

<p>An hour went by, or maybe two, until the inward door opened up
and partisans started walking through. While walking through
the door, Daniel notices a familiar face in the crowd. A big
burly man appeared a few feet ahead of him, making his way
through that door. Daniel tried to apprehend this man weeks
ago, but he was able to break Daniel’s handcuffs with his own
strength. Daniel suddenly remembered that all of these
“Enlightened” were deviants and dangerous to everyone in
town.</p>

<p>The new room was like a large chapel. There were no stained
glass windows, or flying buttresses, but relief statues of men
Daniel did not recognize and a large hanging, metal Aegis.
Daniel took his seat on a bench between the redhead and the
bookworm, and looked around for some sort of speaker or leader
for whom everyone seemed to be hoping to see.</p>

<p>Finally, from behind one of the statues a man in a whining white
robe walked in front of the crows and began his ceremony. “You
are arisen!” he said.</p>

<p>“We have arisen indeed,” the crowd replies.</p>

<p>The robed man smiled and continued, “Today, you have all come
forth from the drear of everyday life into the light of truth,
today you have come out of the cave!”</p>

<p>There was applause.</p>

<p>He spoke again, “We have been hunted, apprehended, and
exterminated for years, but the heart of our culture will stand
strong, our future belongs to us, and no others!” a shout of
approval from the back. The speaker smiled, “The government
spreads misinformation, lies about us. They fear our strength!
They want to stomp on whatever free thought is left in the
world, but we stand in their way. They fear us!” The audience
heartily approved.</p>

<p>“The Teacher tells us that the truth is painful. Only a few
can truly come to know it by overcoming that pain. He says that
those are the men and women who are fit to rul1. Those few are
in this room!” More applause. “The Philosopher says that the
virtuous man is the one who is worthy and correctly estimates
his own worth. Do we overestimate ourselves?” The hall
resounded with a united “NO!”</p>

<p>The speaker waited for his listeners to calm down before he
continued, “But we must be humble. Do not kill or steal without
reason, do not reveal yourselves, or show off your own superior
intelligences, but be prudent in all that you do.” More
applause from the audience.</p>

<p>The leader brought his people under control again and opened his
mouth to speak again when a distant, heavy thud was heard behind
the audience. Daniel’s eyes widened. Everyone looked back
towards the door.</p>

<p>Two of the armored Diafotismenoi were standing by the door, and
they turned to face it. Daniel remembered that he had called
for help some time ago. He tried to move or speak but couldn’t.
He could only watch as the armored men disappeared in a cloud of
dust, and the ornate door was cast through the air down the
center aisle.</p>

<p>One of the men on the benches stood up and reached across his
body, as if looking for a gun. He fell with a loud crack before
he could get inside of his coat.</p>

<p>The dust in the back settled, and nine Apprehension &amp;
Extermination officers stod in the doorway, with their rifles
pointed into the chapel. The denizens of the underground
brotherhood and the invaders from above stared at each other
for a long moment, and then the officers opened fire.</p>

<p>The speaker tried to run to the side of his small stage, but he
fell in a lifeless heap when several new cavities were driven
into his body.</p>

<p>The redheaded girl screamed, and began running, who knows where
to. A bullet caught her calf, and another her chin, and she
disappeared beneath the rows of dwindling bodies.</p>

<p>Another projectile punched through the neck of the sweet girl.
Her lover cried in pain, but soon found his chest speckled with
bullet holes, and collapsed with his beloved.</p>

<p>The man with glasses dove under one of the benches and began to
crawl away. Soon his way was blocked by the body of another,
and he stopped in fear, only to become boxed in, buried by the
bodies of those he considered brothers.</p>

<p>Daniel, losing himself to instinct, tore off his coat disguise
and ducked down as he made his way to the back of the room.
Causality seemed to break down for him. Each cry is preceded by
the thump of metal striking flesh, and followed by the crack of
the discharging weapon. The officers must’ve recognized him or
his uniform, because he made it to the back of the room, and
through the line of shooters. Standing in the hall was the
Chief, accompanied by several other gunmen. Daniel briskly
approached him and stammered a bit, before gasping, “You need
to order them to stop.” another breath. “They have women and
children, they’re not what we make them out to be!”</p>

<p>The Chief raised and eyebrow and took a step within inches of
Daniel. “As you said yourself, they are a threat to society.”</p>

<p>The shooting stopped, the chief stretched his neck and fixed his
collar as Daniel turned back towards the silenced chapel door.
He opened his mouth, but didn’t make a sound as he dropped to
the ground with one final crack.</p>
