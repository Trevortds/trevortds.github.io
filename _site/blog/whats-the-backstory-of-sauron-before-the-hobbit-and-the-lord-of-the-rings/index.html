			<h1>What's the Backstory of Sauron Before the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings?</h1>
		</div>

				<p>Sauron is a Maia.  Created by Eru Ilúvatar (basically God) as a servant to the Valar (somewhere between Greek gods and archangels).  When the world was created, he and several other Maia (who became known as Balrogs), followed Melkor, later known as Morgoth, the rebel Vala, dedicated to corrupting and destroying civilization.</p>

<p>I should probably note at this point that Maia, Vala, and the elves, which have a similar nature to them are primarily spiritual beings.  They are immortal, and they take physical form, but their bodies are temporary.  Maia and Vala and some elves (such as Glorfindel) are powerful enough to build new bodies for themselves when their old ones are destroyed.</p>

<p>Skip a bit, there are a few conflicts, the elves appear in the world, an elf named Feanor makes a set of beautiful gems called the Silmarils, Morgoth steals them and brings them to Middle Earth, a significant number of elves follow him, including Feanor’s family, as well as several other notable elves (Fingolfin, Turgon, Galadriel). And a very long war is fought to attempt to regain the Silmarils.  This part of the story takes place on the sub-continent of Beleriand, maps are available online. This war is the main conflict of The Silmarillion.</p>

<p>With that set up, we now have the elves laying a thousand year siege to Morgoth’s mountain-range-castle-fortress-dungeon, Angband.  The siege is suddenly broken in Dagor Bragollach, the Battle of Sudden Flame. Morgoth’s chief servant, Sauron, takes up residence in the tower of Tol Sirion, the gateway from the grasslands and forests of Beleriand to the wastes of the North and eventually Angband.</p>

<p>In a beautiful love story that you should totally read, a man named Beren takes a solitary quest to obtain a Silmaril at the urging of the Elf-King Thingol for the hand of his daughter Luthien.  He gets some help from the Noldorin High King Finrod.  As they are travelling past Tol Sirion, Sauron sees them and captures them, leaving them in his dungeons with a werewolf.  Luthien, fearing the worst for Beren, escaped her father and travelled to Tol Sirion with the help of a great hound named Huan.  When she arrived there, Sauron attacked Luthien with magic, but her power matched his.  He sent werewolves to kill her, but Huan destroyed all of them.  Knowing of a prophecy that Huan could only be killed by the greatest wolf ever to live, Sauron took the form of a tremendous, monstrous werewolf, and attacked Huan himself, but Huan was able to overpower Sauron, pin him by the neck, and kill him, and Sauron’s spirit departed to Angband. Beren was rescued, and he and Luthien continued on their quest, but that’s another story for another time.</p>

<p>At the end of the story, though, Beren and Luthien do suceed in obtaining a Silmaril, and it falls into the hands of a Mariner named Earendil. Earendil travels across the sundering seas and makes it to Valinor, where the Valar and the High Elves live, and he beseeched them to come to the aid of Middle-earth.  The Valar oblige, and they attack Morgoth.  They capture him and turn Angband inside out, and they cast down the mountains, but they cannot find Sauron. Their power and wrath is so great that they also accidentally destroy Beleriand.  Oops.  This is why, the next time mortals needed help, they only sent the Wizards, lesser Maia who were instructed to advise the people of Middle Earth, but were forbidden from using their full power in the presence of mortals.</p>

<p>Then the rest of Pradeep’s answer takes place.  Sauron builds Barad-Dur in Mordor.  He takes the form of a wise elf and deceives the elves of Eregion into helping him forge 16 rings.  The elves then forge their own three, that he never touches, and he forges the One.  He wages war against the Elves of Eregion and recaptures the sixteen other rings and distributes them, Nine to men, and Seven to dwarves. The Numenorians intervene and defeat him, and he is captured and brought to the island of Numenor.</p>

<p>While there, he eventually climbs his way from prisoner to high priest of an evil religion and chief adviser to the King.  Under his advice, the King then builds a fleet and attempts to attack Valinor.  The gods don’t really like this, so they wipe Numenor off the face of the Earth, separate the continent of Valinor from the world, and then they bend the world into a sphere.  Sauron’s beautiful body is completely destroyed and he is unable to take the same form again.</p>

<p>He rebuilds a body for himself in the form of a great warlord, and rebuilds Barad-Dur, and Mordor. Before he has a chance to attack, he is soundly defeated by the Last Alliance of Men and Elves, but not without managing to kill the last High King of the Elves, Gil-Galad, as well as Elendil, High King of the Numenorians, and one of his two sons, Anarion. He is killed, but his body is not destroyed.  Isildur cuts the One from his hand and takes it as a souvenir.</p>

<p>With the loss of the power of the One, Sauron is weak.  Depending on which version of Tolkien’s notes you subscribe to, he is either completely formless, or he is trapped in his terrifying warlord body.  I prefer the latter. He travels to Dol Guldur, where he lies low and takes up the name “The Necromancer” in the hopes that his enemies won’t realize who he really is, and just take him to be an insane human wielder of dark magic.  Gandalf discovers him, this is where the Hobbit begins.  After the events of the Hobbit, the White Council gathers their armies and roots him out of Dol Guldur.</p>

<p>By this point, the line of Kings in Gondor has been lost, save for the little known Rangers in the North, and they become lax in their vigilance. Barad-Dur is rebuilt, and Minas Ithil (Tower of the Moon)is captured and renamed Minas Morgul(Tower of Death). Osgiliath is destroyed completely, and the capital of Gondor is moved to Minas Anor(Tower of the Sun), renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard). That’s about the state of things at the beginning of the Lord of the Rings.</p>

<p>After the One Ring is destroyed, most of Sauron’s power is removed from the world.  He no longer has any ability to construct a body for himself, or indeed to cause any change in the physical world.</p>

<p>I hope the context contained here helps you to understand his character a little better. This is, to the best of my knowledge, a description of every event in the Legendarium that relates to Sauron.</p>
