A boy and his balloon  

He walks, stumbles, stutters through the street,  
Alone and small he travels among  
The white and grey feathers flapping for food  
In a world full of color and life  

His companions are always there  
He holds them tight as they might disperse  
Still he holds them, a strong leader, grave  
They keep to him as if tied with iron chain.  

He sees the mountain, great and tall  
with marble walls and roaring falls  
with roosts for birds to wet their necks  
and pools that shine with gold  
 
The then goes past the mighty tree  
With broad leaves and strong branches.  
Taller than the mountain it seems  
A true life-giver, majestic, and great  

The way is fraught with trouble  
Stone men stand in between    
The hero and his destination  
With flat heads and long arms  
With swords and spears  
That curl and twist in strange ways  
Yet he defeats them, and pushes through.  

He meets many characters on his way  
The fearful dog that yaps and naps  
The old man at his game  
The businessman with much to do  
And the teenagers with none  

And as he trudges along his way,  
All of these he passes by  
Tired and weak by end of day  

He stops and rises towards the sky.
