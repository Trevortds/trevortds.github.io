This is a test, and little more
and very few will see it.
for I have never blogged before
and none will ever read it

It may take me some months or years
before I try to write,
or maybe its my silly fears
that keeps my mind locked tight

perhaps someone could help me out,
somebody who can teach
someone who, without a doubt
can help me in my speech

For I have many profound thoughts,
opinions, funny stories,
enough to entertain a lot
of blog-post scanning lories

but now, alas, there's more to do:
explore my page and this blog, too
if this is ever seen again,
well, I'll have taken up the pen.
