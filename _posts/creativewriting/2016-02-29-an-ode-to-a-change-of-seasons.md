#Ode to A Change of Seasons 

The sadness rests, the thoughts run through
Of the darkest of times: a death gathering heard,
But a funeral is given to who?
Surely to a brave soul belongs this word.
What is it changing seasons surely show;
What changes like the years, in one?
What great feelings does it bring to me,
What troubles does it help us know?
Of whom do we think in the bright red sun?
The disk brings bright thought of life to me.

The crimson sun rises in the distance.
It brings back memories of old, brighter days.
Days when my young mind was marked with innocence,
Then seeking knowledge was my way.
Like green leaves fading to orange and gold
That fall and blow away in autumn winds,
So the thoughts continue, though I struggle to hold on.
My own failures in my mind stand out bold.
Ignorance alone surrounds my lonely mind.
For the first time there is nothing to concentrate on.

The tunes take me to a dramatic change.
Years ago in the coldness of fall season
A man did in the hall arrange
A speech to avid students of reason.
The message he gave was “Carpe Diem!
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may”.
Then the student returned back home.
He appreciated life again and redeemed
Himself in the eyes of his friends that day,
Just in time, for then she was lost in the foam.

The seasons have changed and so have I:
From my youthful ignorance to aged wisdom.
The greatest lesson I’ve learned is in our reply
To time, to whom we all fall victim.
Times have passed that can’t be relived.
Life always continues, though it never goes straight.
But now as the crimson sun sets,
The knowledge from wisdom I will try to give
To my young son, it’s taught only by fate.
I’ve done what I could, at last I can rest.
