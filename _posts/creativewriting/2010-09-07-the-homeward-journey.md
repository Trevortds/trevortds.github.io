Young traveler listen to my tale
Of woes, and foes, and fate.
For I, a hero once now frail,
Will tell you of years late
 
Returning from the deadly war
My men and I did sail
‘Round coasts we’ve never seen before
But our strength did not fail.
 
We met a mighty sorceress
Of two warnings she told:
“Beware the maelstrom Charybdis
The gaping maw of old.
 
And Scylla of six heads be warned!
She lies by southern coasts,
And picks the men from ships she’s shorn,
But neither killed the most:
 
To dodge the straits you must sail south
Between the floating rocks.
One ship alone has made it through:
That of the Argonauts.
 
When ship sails in the rocks draw close
And crush with hard stone, coarse.
To charge the straits or try the rocks
My lord, the choice is yours.”
I pondered long as we sailed forth
Towards my fateful choice.
I chose to go the path up north,
But none could yet rejoice.
 
Now to the strait we came with dread;
We’d come between them soon.
We sailed towards Scylla with six heads;
Far lesser death and doom.
 
The beast arose from darkened sea,
Six heads on serpent necks.
The tent’cled limbs did frighten me.
With these she’d caused such wrecks.
 
I told the men to arm themselves
With swords and spears long grown.
The beast out in the distance delved
Into the waves, unknown.
 
She surfaced right beside our ship
The hissing heads did show.
She stared down at my boat and nipped
At blades of men in rows.
 
Once solid shafts had been all broken
The heads reached in and took
With razor teeth my six best men,
Their lifeless limbs she shook.
 
 
The heads reached down to snatch again
But on the deck I stand
To strike against the death of men,
Hilted bronze sword in hand.
 
I stood up tall and struck with steel,
But Scylla did not fear.
If she would try to strike I’d kneel
And stab at her mouth’s rear.
 
She did attack, I held my ground,
My mind then held no fear.
So I held forth the steel and found
Blade stuck in her mouth’s rear.
 
She pulled away, I pulled the blade,
And out it came, blood drenched.
Her body in the depths did fade
To heal in some deep trench.
 
But now the whirlpool held us fast,
We’d drifted towards its ken.
O now our ship will fail at last,
I’d lost my six best men.
 
We hoisted sail, we manned the oars
And strove with all our might.
But wind blew string and our sails tore!
Our hearts were filled with fright.
 
 
The ship slid back, but on we fought.
The foam was drawing near!
We saw are efforts were for naught,
As roaring waves we hear.
 
So in despair I told them then
To pray to gods on high.
Else no one would come home again;
There in the strait we’d die.
 
Minerva smiled on me that day,
For when the ship went down
Washed into the watery way
Alone I did not drown.
 
I saw me men die one by one,
They sank into the deeps.
By timber, by water lived none
Of men now Hades keeps.
 
I’m forced to wander on by fate,
But memories I keep
Of soldiers with great riches bait
To death down in the deep.
 
But now my friend I must move on,
This is the way I go,
My kingdom waits, I must move on
In hopes I get back home.
