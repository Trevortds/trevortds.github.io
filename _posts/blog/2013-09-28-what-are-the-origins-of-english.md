England

I really want to leave it at that, but I am infamously thorough, especially when answering questions such as these. Waaaaay back during the middle-ages, there were two tribes living in Northern Germany.  One of them (which held a lot of territory in modern day Denmark) were called the Angles, the other, (which bordered them to the South) were called Saxons.  The languages they spoke were so similar, that many modern linguists consider them to be the same language, often called "Anglo-Saxon" or sometimes, "Old English"  
At this time however, the language was more like modern German.  Here is an example of Old English/Anglo-Saxon. 

>wiges weorðmynd,         þæt him his winemagas   
georne hyrdon,         oðð þæt seo geogoð geweox,   
magodriht micel.         Him on mod bearn   
þæt healreced         hatan wolde,

-Beowulf


Near the end of the classical period (~100BC), mainland Europeans discovered the British Isles, which were then populated by Celts.  The Romans were pushed out, but Vikings, Angles, and Saxons began colonizing Great Britain.  The two tribes began to mix, and soon the name "Angelcynn", derived from the Angle tribe, came to refer to all of the German colonists, and they founded the Kingdom of England, and their combined language became known as English (what we now call Old English).    
In this image you can see the colonies of the Anglo-Saxon tribes.  Most of the island is still controlled by Celts, who would eventually be pushed back into just Scotland and Wales. The Jutes were another Germanic tribe, but they were quickly assimilated into Anglo-Saxon Culture.  Northumbria was long fought over by the Kingdom of England and the Viking Invaders, and once they were pushed out, Lothian was ceded to the Scots who threatened war.

In 1066 AD the Normans of Northern France (led by William the Conqueror) invaded England and conquered the kingdom and established a new monarchy.  The Duke of Normandy took the additional title of King of England.  His descendants later went to war with Wales, Scotland, and Ireland (which was famously conquered by Richard the Lionheart before he went on the 3rd Crusade).  Later, in the 14th century, the English descendant of William the Conqueror, Edward III, had a claim to the French Throne, and launched an invasion of France that resulted in the Hundred Years War (1337-1453), which ended when the English were defeated at Castillon and lost all of their territory in mainland Europe, except for Calais (this would become important in a large conflict about 500 years later).  
During this period, since the nobility of England came from France, French was the dominant or "high" language of the nation, and Old English was spoken by the peasantry.  Over time, as the two classes mingled, a new language was born, with mostly Old English grammar, but mostly French vocabulary, and we call this Middle English.   
The origin of Middle English is particularly interesting in its long lasting effects, as it resulted in a lot of synonyms in Modern English, one from Romance languages through French, and the other Germanic through Anglo-Saxon.  This is most obvious for our terms for meat: the dish is called by its French derived name: "steak, ham, poultry" and the animal by its Old English derived name: "Cow, pig, chicken".  This is very uncommon in other languages worldwide, where the meat and the animal are called by the same word. Here is an example of Middle English:

>Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote  
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote  
And bathed every veyne in swich licour,  
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;  
-Chaucer, The Caunterbury Tales  


Almost readable, right? Take note: this is why we have so many weird spellings in Modern English: everything that is written above is pronounced literally, meaning that there are no silent "e"s.  As time passed, we changed the way we talk, but not the way we spell.  
The rest of the story is pretty boring.  In the 15th and 16th century, there was a Renaissance in England, many writers, artists, and intellectuals flourished (such as William Shakespeare, Thomas More, and Francis Bacon).  There was a sudden interest in Ancient Latin and Greek ideas, and many words from those languages entered English through philosophers and scientists.  By the time these three famous men wrote, English grammar had stabilized, and formed what we now know as Modern English, which was spoken with little variation ever since.   
Then there was imperialism, English spread to North America, South Africa, Australia, and India, and while many of these colonies eventually got independence, their people still spoke a dialect of English, not unlike that used in Britain. In World War 2, the vast majority of Allied armies spoke English, especially once America, Canada, and Australia joined the fight.  France, Italy, and Germany were defeated, and English became the dominant language in Western Europe for diplomacy, if not everyday life. The sheer economic power of the United States in the decades since, combined with the already extensive influence of English in the port cities (a remnant of the British Empire) have resulted in English becoming the *Lingua Franca* of nearly the whole world. 
That is where English originated.
