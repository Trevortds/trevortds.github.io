On “God's Not Dead”. 

This weekend, I went to see the new movie, God's Not Dead. In spite of, or perhaps because of, the fact that many others seem to like the movie very much, I feel I need to write this review, addressing why I think it is a terrible, terrible movie, and deserves worse than the 20% rating it currently has on Rotten Tomatoes and 16% on Metacritic.

First, the technical stuff. I was more or less happy with the execution of the film. The sets were good, though there were a few too many “soap-opera style” camera angles. The acting talent wasn't bad, Kevin Sorbo captured his character pretty well, as did Shane Harper, though Cassidy Gifford's performance as the “main character”'s girlfriend was particularly wooden. The film's sound, however, was beyond awful. It could have been done better if recorded with my $30 flipphone from 2006. It was staticy, noisy, and the producers made a half-baked attempt to cover it up by cutting the sound entirely whenever a character wasn't speaking. It was extremely noticeable and very distracting.

The whole movie was an advertisement for the Newsboys and Duck Dynasty. There, I said it. I was suspicious when, in the first ten minutes, I counted the Newsboys logo printed on five different objects, including the T-shirt that the main character was wearing and two posters on his dorm room wall. The movie contains five completely unrelated plots, and the audience is expected to roll with the unasked for and unexpected scene changes because one character from each of the plots winds up at a Newsboys concert at the end. Each of the first five scenes in the movie introduces a new “main character”, they never meet, they never talk, they just end up in the same place in the last five minutes. One of these characters is a reporter who, in her first scene, interviews Willie Robertson from Duck Dynasty, asking him about animal rights and why he prays on his show, and I can't help but ask, “Why should I care? This is not what I came to see”. Of course, that eventually became totally justified when Willie appeared for five seconds at the Newsboys Concert, telling the audience (and the film audience) to text everyone they know, “God's Not Dead”.

Furthermore, each of the five plots was based entirely on gross stereotypes. The Chinese kid who tests out of all of his classes and is berated by his father for not being good enough, the Atheist who dumps his girlfriend when he finds out she has cancer, because Atheists don't believe in love, the Muslim man who beats his daughter because that's what Muslim people do, the white male freshman student who defeats the evil atheist professor using arguments lifted from those annoying chain emails from last decade. And the stereotype to top them all: the atheist doesn't actually disbelieve in God, he knows that God exists, DUH, I mean, who would disbelieve in God? It's not like there are any Christians who think or wonder or doubt sometime in their lives. It turns out, he calls himself an atheist because he hates God, and you can't hate something that doesn't exist. All you have to do is stop hating God, and hey, you're a Christian again! This is the big argument at the end of the movie that wins the professor over. Somehow the professor doesn't think of the simple counterargument that immediately popped into my head “I hate Voldemort, Palpatine, President Snow, and Sauron, but I don't believe that they exist”.

Finally, my biggest problem with this movie has nothing to do with the movie at all, but the culture that produced it. Let me tell you this: there are zero non-Christians who will be turned by this movie. This movie is more likely to turn people away from Christianity than it is to draw people towards Christ, because it portrays every non-Christian as messed up somehow and clearly in the wrong, when it's just not that clear. All of modern Christian media does this: it presents the Christian worldview, Christian morality, Christian theology as the only obvious and correct way to think about life, and if you think anything else, you're wrong because of cliché argument A B and C. We need more movies like Les Miserables, where there is doubt, and it is shown that life is more complicated than black and white.

Modern Christians have been more and more demanding their own music, their own films, their own television, their own culture different from the rest, and that is not what Christianity is about. In fact, it is the antithesis of Christianity. Maybe other people are reading a different Bible from me, but last I checked, there is no part that says “For God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son so that a bunch of iconoclastic self-indulgent misanthropes could segregate themselves from the rest of humanity and feel all high and mighty by doing so.” We are God's ambassador's on Earth. If the British ambassador to the United States sat in his house in DC all day, and only talked to his British friends, and only watched British television and listened to British music, would you call him a good ambassador? Certainly not. In the words of wise Ambrose, “When in Rome, do as the Romans do”. Hymns and Worship music and inspirational videos in Church are one thing, but when you spend your entire life, never interacting with anyone who disagrees with you, what does that say about you? How real is your faith if it's never tested? How can you judge what is good when you keep away from the bad, how can you know what is the truth, when you've never heard another claim of what's true? How can you claim to be a disciple of Christ, when you've never shared the Good News?

“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”
Mat. 9:9-13

Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire; he breaks out against all sound judgment.
Proverbs 18:1
