## Original Question:

### What does it feel like if the house you are in is hit by lightning?
Unless you are connected to the house's electrical system, you won’t die, that’s the good news.

If you are in a high occupancy building, a tall building, or an expensive building, it will have systems in place to divert electric flow in a safe direction, so you will feel nothing. Even better than not being dead!

If you’re in a normal house with no special lightning protection, and you aren’t hit directly in a stroke of remarkably bad luck, you will feel pain in your ears from the very loud bang above and around you, followed by deafness, followed by panic and confusion as all the walls have caught fire.

You see, when the current of lightning goes through your house’s internal wiring, your wires turn into lightbulb filaments, and then into fuses, and then into exploding fuses. You need to very thoroughly search for fires, they often start in the walls or in the attic. Then you need to count all of your electronics that aren’t fried. A surge protector usually isn’t enough to save your computer, and your phone, and your everything else that was plugged in when the lightning struck.

Then you need to pick out the glass shards from your dog. Oh, did I not mention? The shock of the thunder at range zero has a tendency to shatter glass. And wood. And rock. And brick. And concrete. Make sure all that stuff isn’t broken.

I mean, aside from the pain, and the fear, and the panic, and the material loss, it feels like not being dead, I guess, so, pretty good. Enjoy.




For now.
