[Resume here]({{ site.url}}/about/TSullivanResume.pdf) (last updated March 2020)

I am a python developer and NLP engineer specializing in search and machine learning. Until March 2020 I worked at Ayfie 
inc. as a Professional Services Engineer, making custom programs and scripts for customers to integrate their systems and
data sources with Ayfie's Inspector search and text analytics product. Typically this involves  

I hold a Masters degree in Human Language Technology from the University of Arizona. 

As for the contents of this website, this is a place for me to post my thoughts, written work, and development logs. I post here very sparingly. 



Professionally, I work on state-of-the-art search technologies, to improve the run performance and user experience of database or web searching. I also have expertise in other areas of natural language processing, including statistical and rule-based (automaton) methods of parsing, sentiment analysis, translation, synthesis, and recognition, to varying degrees. 

I'm well trained in Object Oriented Programming, and test-driven development from my computer science background, and came 
to be proficient at rapid-prototyping and functional programming from my Masters education.

I am comfortable working in Scala and Python, these are my go-to languages, but I also have a various degrees of experience in
 each of: Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Perl, Prolog, Matlab, C#, C, and MIPS assembly, in roughly decreasing order of comfort.  
 I'm also proficient in client-side web technologies (HTML/CSS/Javascript) and the Flask web backend, based on Python.
 
I am an L1 English speaker and have day-to-day essentials proficiency in German. 

As for hobby, I tend to cycle between various projects and interests every few months. Lately among them: jazz guitar, 
cryptography, PC video games, small electronics, building keyboards, 3d printing, a commute tracking app, and a cocktail
  recipe app.

# Biography

I grew up in South Jersey, in the greater Philadelphia area, and there are some vestiges of that upbringing in my accent,
 particularly back vowels and the odd pronunciation of particular lexemes, like "water". 

My father is a network engineer, and his employers got tired of flying him across the country to work on their machines,
 so they moved us to Arizona, where there is no rain, no humidity, and no natural disasters: the ideal location for server 
 farms and tech offices. 

Upon arrival in Arizona I found the quality of public education in the state which spends the least money per capita on 
education underwhelming, so I was soon enrolled in a private school that was marginally better. 

I was invited to attend a brand new High School in Glendale, AZ, the Glendale Preparatory Academy, a rigorous liberal-arts 
education that was far above the standards of surrounding area education, so I jumped at the chance to join. It was there
 that I discovered my love for language, history, and the classics. I was a high-ranking member of the first ever graduating class,
  23 students in total, and I moved to Tucson to attend the University of Arizona. There were some business shakeups that 
  resulted in my family running off to Maryland the very same week. Literally, my dad dropped me off at the dorm, and then
   just kept going on the I-10 all the way to Savannah, then to Annapolis. 

At the time I fancied myself a musician, and I was in the College of Music as a vocal student. However, towards the end 
of my first year, I found that I enjoyed my linguistics classes much more than the music ones. That discovery, combined with 
a bout of laryngitis on finals week and an excellent summer course in Linux system administration, led me to change focus 
towards Computer Science and Linguistics. 


After finishing school I moved to Union City NJ to work for Ayfie in New York. I periodically visited Munich, home of 
Ayfie's development office, which is my favorite city. After two years, the American Ayfie team was moved to Denver, where I 
currently reside.
